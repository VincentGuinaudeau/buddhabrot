# buddhabrot
a program to generate buddhabrot images and some more

## install (linux only for now)
clone the repository somewhere on your computer.

On a terminal, cd in the repository, then build the program :

```sh
$ make
```

You may need to install packages depending of your distribution.

Also, you can configure witch compilater to use by opening the `Makefile` and setting the `CC` variable to the name of compilater (`clang` by default).

To clean all the intermediate files, use `make clean`; To clean all files generated by the build, use `make fclean`; To rebuild entierly, use `make re`.

## Generating a buddhabrot image

```sh
$ ./buddhabrot [OPTION]
```

This will generate a file named `test.pgm` on the current active directory.

### Options

 * `-w` Width : the width of the image
 * `-h` Height : the height of the image
 * `-s` Sample size : the number of point to find
 * `-m` Minimum : the minimum of step for a point to qualify
 * `-M` Maximum : the maximum of step for a point to qualify

Example for a 4k image (width and height inverted to rotate the image afterward)

```sh
$ ./buddhabrot -w 4320 -h 7680
```

## Algorithm

The program launch one thread per actual thread available on the computer.

For now, the program look at random point until it found a point that escape the circle of radius 2 between `-m` and `-M` steps.
